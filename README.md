# speed_typing_test
 Speed typing test with GUI using tkinter library to measure and display typing speed.


The above program is a speed typing test implemented using the `tkinter` library in Python. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for the typing test.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. Import the necessary libraries: We import the `tkinter` library for creating the GUI and the `time` module for measuring the time taken during the typing test.

2. Define the functions:
   - `calculate_typing_speed`: This function calculates the typing speed by dividing the number of words typed by the total time taken.
   - `start_typing_test`: This function is called when the user clicks the "Start" button. It records the start time and updates the GUI.
   - `end_typing_test`: This function is called when the user finishes typing and clicks the "Submit" button. It records the end time, calculates the typing speed, and updates the GUI with the result.

3. Create the GUI:
   - Create a `tkinter` window and set its title.
   - Create labels and buttons to display instructions and capture user input.
   - Associate the respective functions with the buttons.

4. Run the GUI:
   - Start the main event loop to run the GUI.

When the program is run, a window appears with instructions to type a specific sentence. The user can click the "Start" button to begin the typing test. The program records the start time and displays a text entry field for the user to type the sentence. Once the user finishes typing, they can click the "Submit" button. The program then records the end time, calculates the typing speed, and displays it in the GUI.

Feel free to modify the code to suit your requirements or enhance the GUI design further.
